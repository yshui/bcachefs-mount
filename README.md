    -p, --password <password>    
            Where the password would be loaded from.
            
            Possible values are: "fail" - don't ask for password, fail if filesystem is encrypted; "wait" - wait for
            password to become available before mounting; "ask" -  prompt the user for password; [default: fail]

    <mountpoint>    
            Where the filesystem should be mounted
```

Caveats
=======

* `--password ask` is not yet implemented, but you ask use `--password wait`, and load the key with `bcachefs unlock`.
